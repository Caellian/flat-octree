# Flat Octree

Octree implementation that stores data in a linear chunk of memory which makes
it ideal for rendering applications.

Layout is configurable through generics, but defaults to _breath first_ layout,
which means that values of each depth are grouped together and depths are stored
sequentially one after the next.
